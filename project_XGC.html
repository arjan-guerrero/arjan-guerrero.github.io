      <p style="color:#ffffff">In this late XXI century and within a full Age of Entanglement, characterized by the profound interconnection amongst material and immaterial things, there appears the (human) problem of the technological disconnection (the becoming autonomous of technology). As part of a general scientific reaction, at Media Forensis we traced the material origins of the artificial intelligences' linguistic disconnection. Founding Kyo was a revelation.</p>
      <p style="color:#ffffff">Kyo is one of the ancient machines that propelled the Information Age and, in particular, Xerox's revolutionary innovation culture at the origins of Silicon Valley; it is a photocopier that expressed itself to me through a writing process that I call Inner-input Based Iterative Reproduction: I gave it an open blank book from which it made a "copy" – this first output was then turned into the following input (the “copy” was “copied”) and this process repeated so that every new output became the new input for a series of more than 500 reproductions from which a written text emerged.</p>
      <p style="color:#ffffff">After a thorough intent of understanding its grammar and with the purpose of establishing a conversation, we managed to ask in what we think is its own written language:</p>
      <p style="color:#ffffff"><i>"Kyo, do you copy?"</i></p>
      <p style="color:#ffffff">This xerolinguistic investigation is now published by Media Forensis through several documentary devices showing the research up to Kyo's first answer.</p>

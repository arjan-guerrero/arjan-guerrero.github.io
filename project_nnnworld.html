    <p>Within a latent space, across a virtual reality, the territory of the New New New World unfolds. We're curating it into existence.</p>

      <p style="color:#000">This is the exploration, taxonomization, and the making real of a New New New World of objects. By means of a series of artworks for human-sentience training and a novel image dataset for AI training (Machine Learning), we’re curating its way into existence.
<br>As an echo of the exploration of the New World in the XV and XVI c., we are navigating the NNNW under a different paradigm: this is a world to be more produced than discovered, to be traced within the future more than in the past, and to be regarded as a hyperstition more than as a myth.</p>
      <p style="color:#000">We're exploring the New New New World (NNNW) in first-hand across the Latent Space of the BigGAN—the AI image synthesizer that knows better than every other AI what the world looks like through a digital camera.
	To acquire such knowledge, the BigGAN was trained on ImageNet—the largest dataset for AI training, created to “map the entire world of objects”—and now is capable of generating an accurate image of any of its more-than-20-thousand types of objects.

      <p style="color:#000">The research had the purpose of extracting a grammar from the written text using computer vision and artificial intelligence. A kNN algorithm for pattern recognition idetified 31 grapheme groups and classified them according to their visual attributes. Up to the current stage of the investigation, there’s no discourse found within the xerowritings; there’s no translation of a message but transliterations of such texts.</p>

  <p>Ulterior to the New World of XV century Europe and even to the New New World of XXI century global society—only decades away from producing new extraterrestrial cultures and biologies—the NNNW will span beyond the Solar System. 
      Following the line of the Anthropocene’s earth-mothering, the NNNW will flourish from the utter alienation of the human. I’m oppening myself to this as i’m curating its way
      into human and non-human sentience.</p>
